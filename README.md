## GuusVM - A Virtual Machine for Guus Smart Contracts
GuusVM is an implementation of a virtual machine designed to run smart contracts on Guus. This VM simulates a secure environment where contracts can be deployed and executed, maintaining the privacy and security ethos of Guus.

## Features
- Stack-based Execution: Implements a stack for managing data during contract execution.
- Memory Management: Provides memory operations for temporary data storage and retrieval.
- Gas Mechanism: Ensures computational resource usage is monitored through gas consumption.
- Opcode Execution: Supports basic arithmetic, memory operations, and control flow instructions.
- Bytecode Validation: Includes functionality to validate contract bytecode before execution.

## Getting Started
- Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Usage
Running the VM
To execute a script with GuusVM:
```
from monero_vm import MoneroVM

# Initialize VM with gas limit
vm = MoneroVM(initial_gas=100000)

# (replace with actual bytecode from contract compilation)
bytecode = [0x01, 0x05, 0x06, 0x00]  # bytecode for ADD, MLOAD, MSTORE, STOP

try:
    success = vm.execute(bytecode)
    if success:
        print("Contract executed successfully!")
    else:
        print("Contract execution stopped.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Execution error: {e}")

print(f"Remaining gas: {vm.get_remaining_gas()}")
```

## Validating Bytecode

```
from monero_vm import MoneroVM

vm = MoneroVM(initial_gas=100000)  # Gas is not consumed during validation
bytecode = [0x01, 0x05, 0x06, 0x00]  # bytecode

is_valid = vm.validate_bytecode(bytecode)
print(f"Bytecode validation: {'Passed' if is_valid else 'Failed'}")
```

## Contract Development
Write your contracts in Python using the provided contract structure.
Compile contracts to bytecode.
Deploy contracts by creating a transaction with the bytecode in the transaction's extra field.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Here are some ways to contribute:

- Add new opcodes to extend VM functionality.
- Improve gas calculation for different operations.
- Enhance memory management or add privacy-preserving features.
- Write or improve tests for existing features.
